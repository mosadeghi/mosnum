A simple library to work with matrices and performing basic operations on them in golang.
- The name is a wordplay with [__mos__]adeghi + [__num__]eric (inspired by numpy :D), narcissistic huh?

## Why?
<p>
As a class project for a linear algebra course at the University of Gilan, I decided to implement a simple library that includes structures for storing matrices and a bunch of functions for performing some basic operations on them (such as basic row and column operations and implementing an algorithm for solving a system of linear equations using matrices).
</p>
<p>
  While there are many tools for the same purpose available as software or software libraries for various languages such as Python and even Golang, for educational purposes, I decided to implement the library from scratch using only the basic structures of the programming language.
</p>
<p>
The Golang language was chosen because its syntax is very similar to Python, which most of us are familiar with, and it is very readable and simple. Two other reasons for choosing this language for this project are its explicit type system compared to a language like Python and, of course, my recent interest and involvement with this language.
